Trainee
=======

This repository contains all the deliverables from trainees.

All the trainees are supposed to create a folder of their name (your HOME folder) and work only under that folder. 

It is recommended that within your HOME, you should create the same hierarchy as it's there in the [Training Repo](http://github.com/bluecocoon/training). It'll help others to browse your HOME folder.
